/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and purchases,
 *              allows public read access to car and testimonial data, and restricts write access
 *              to cars and testimonials to authenticated users only. Contact form entries are writeable by all.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *  /users/{userId} (UserProfile): Stores public information about a user, accessible only by the user themselves.
 *  /users/{userId}/purchases/{purchaseId} (Purchase): Stores purchase history, accessible only by the user themselves.
 *  /cars/{carId} (Car): Stores car details, publicly readable but writeable by authenticated users.
 *  /testimonials/{testimonialId} (Testimonial): Stores testimonials, publicly readable but writeable by authenticated users.
 *  /contact_form_entries/{contactFormEntryId} (ContactFormEntry): Stores contact form submissions, writeable by all.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *  - Car and Testimonial data is publicly readable.
 *  - All write operations require authentication.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *  - The `Purchase` entity includes a `userId` field, denormalizing the user's ID for efficient authorization checks.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 *  - There is no need for structural segregation of data.
